### **1. Data Collection**:

- Dataset downloaded from a specified URL or source.
- Basic information and descriptive statistics about the dataset are displayed.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**:

- Handled missing values in `TotalCharges` using median imputation.
- Encoded categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding as appropriate.
- Standardized numerical features to improve model convergence.

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

- Generated a heatmap to visualize feature correlations.
- Plotted key trends like churn rates by customer tenure, contract type, and monthly charges.
- Analyzed distributions and identified outliers.

### **4. Modeling**:

- Split data into training and test sets using an 80-20 split.
- Trained multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM.
- Compared models using cross-validation.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning for the best-performing model.

### **5. Evaluation**:

- Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
- Visualized confusion matrices and ROC curves for a deeper evaluation.
